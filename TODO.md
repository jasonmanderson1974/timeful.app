# Timeful / The Fellowship — Improvement & Feature Backlog

> Compiled 2026-07-22 from a full-codebase review. Context that shaped priorities:
> this is a **self-hosted, invite-only fork** for a **~30–40 person club** (≈12 men + wives).
> That means: **reliability, maintainability, and small-club utility** matter far more
> than horizontal scale, multi-tenant concerns, or growth/monetization features.
> Companion docs: `REDESIGN_PLAN.md`, `ACCESS_CONTROL_PLAN.md`.

## PART A — Refactoring & Code-Health

### P0 — Correctness & risk (do first)

- [x] **A1 · Standardize `c.Bind` failure responses.** `S` — **DONE 2026-07-22 (events.go).**
  Correction to the original finding: the `events.go` sites use `c.Bind` (not `c.ShouldBind`), and
  Gin's `c.Bind` **already** calls `AbortWithError(400)` internally — so these returned a **400 with
  an empty body**, not a silent 200. (A true 200-on-bad-input would only occur at `ShouldBind`
  sites, which already return proper JSON.) So A1 was a *consistency* issue, not a silent-success
  bug. Fixed all **11** `events.go` bind handlers to return `c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest,
  responses.Error{Error: err.Error()})` (removing the lone `fmt.Println` debug print and the
  bare/`c.Status`-only variants). **Follow-up:** the other route files' bind handlers already use
  either `ShouldBindJSON` with a JSON error body or `BindJSON` (also auto-400) — spot-check for
  consistency but no silent-200 bug found.

- [x] **A2 · Stop panicking inside request handlers on DB errors.** `M` — **FULLY DONE 2026-07-22
  (route handlers + `db/` + `services/`).** Only intentional fail-fast panics remain (`db/init.go`
  startup, `auth.go generateOtpCode` crypto/rand — see below). Converted every handler `Panicln` to
  `logger.StdErr.Println(err)` +
  `c.JSON(500, responses.Error{Error: errs.Internal})` + `return`: `events.go` (12),
  `user.go` (16), `auth.go` (5). `signInHelper` (a helper returning `(models.User, error)`)
  propagates the error instead — `return models.User{}, err`. Two handler `Panicln`s that were
  actually *bind* errors (`toggleCalendar`, `toggleSubCalendar`) now return 400. The
  `importEvent` response loop logs + `continue`s (event already inserted). `admin.go`,
  `folders.go`, `stripe.go`, `users.go` had none.
  **Intentionally left:** `auth.go generateOtpCode()` — a `crypto/rand` failure (not a DB error),
  in a helper returning `string` with no context; converting needs a signature change and the
  failure is astronomically rare.
  **`db/` + `services/` — partially DONE 2026-07-22 (the safe, error-returning subset):**
  Converted the panics in functions that *already return an `error`* (or error-like) so the error
  now flows through the return value instead of panicking — no signature change, no caller change:
  `db/folders.go CreateFolder` (the `return …, err` after it was dead code), `services/calendar/
  google_calendar.go` `GetCalendarList`/`GetCalendarEvents` (4 sites), `services/contacts/
  contacts.go SearchContacts` (2 sites — returns `*errs.GoogleAPIError{Code: 500}` so the caller's
  `c.JSON(googleError.Code, …)` stays valid). This also fixes a **latent goroutine crash**: the
  calendar async wrappers `recover()` with `err.(error)`, but `log.Panicln` panics with a *string*,
  so that assertion would itself panic and take down the process — now moot, since these no longer
  panic.

  **Deliberately NOT refactored (assessment, not laziness):** the ~40 remaining `Panicln`s in
  value-returning/void `db/` getters (`GetUserById`, `GetEventById`, …) and `services/`
  (`GetTokensFromAuthCode`, `RefreshAccessToken`, `CallApi`, `GetUserInfo`, `CreateEmailTask`).
  Reasons: (1) these getters already `return nil`/empty on *not-found* (callers handle it) and only
  panic on an *unexpected* DB error; (2) **every** such path is already contained — request handlers
  by `gin.Recovery()` (→ 500, the correct status), and all db/service-calling **goroutines** by
  their own `defer recover()` (verified: `events.go` 1005/1053/1422, calendar + auth async wrappers).
  So there is no crash bug left to fix. A full signature refactor would touch **80+ call sites**
  (`GetUserById` alone has 20) with **no local Go compiler** to verify — high risk, low benefit.
  If desired later, do it **incrementally, one function at a time, gated by Backend CI** — not as a
  single sweep. `db/init.go` panics are startup/fail-fast and should stay.

  **Incremental refactor — batch 1 DONE 2026-07-22 (CI-green):** de-panicked the lowest-caller
  getters — `db/utils.go` (`GetDailyUserLogByDate`→`(_, error)`, `UpdateDailyUserLog`,
  `GetFriendRequestById`/`DeleteFriendRequestById` — the last two have 0 callers, i.e. **dead code**,
  candidates for deletion), `GetEventsCreatedThisMonth`→`(int, error)`, `GetUserByStripeCustomerId`
  →`(*User, error)`. **Remaining tiers (heads-up — entangled/high-caller):** the event getters
  (`GetEventById`, `GetEventByShortId`, `GetEventByEitherId`, `GenerateShortEventId`) are a **single
  cluster** — `GetEventByEitherId` (11 callers) calls the other two, so they must move together
  (~17 call sites). `GetUserById` (20 callers) and `GetUserByEmail` (8) are the other big ones, plus
  `GetEventResponses`/`GetAttendees` (slices) and the `services/` functions (`CallApi`,
  `GetTokensFromAuthCode`, `RefreshAccessToken`, `GetUserInfo`, `CreateEmailTask`). These are the
  high-effort/low-benefit end (all already recovered → 500); decide whether they're worth it.

  **Batch 2 DONE 2026-07-22 (CI-green):** the event-getter cluster —
  `GetEventById`/`GetEventByShortId`/`GetEventByEitherId` → `(*Event, error)`, ~17 call sites
  updated (11 handlers → 500; `main.go` + db-internal callers keep nil-checks). `GenerateShortEventId`
  kept its `string` signature (handles the error internally).

  **Batch 3 DONE 2026-07-22:** the user-getter cluster — `GetUserById` → `(*User, error)` (20 callers)
  and `GetUserByEmail` → `(*User, error)` (8 callers) in `db/users.go`. Call-site handling by context:
  request handlers → 500 (`middleware/auth.go`, `routes/users.go` ×2, `routes/user.go` ×3,
  `routes/auth.go` ×3, `routes/events.go` handlers); `signInHelper` propagates
  `return models.User{}, err`; async goroutines (email-send blocks in `updateEventResponse`) and
  counted loops (`getResponses` populate loops, calendar-fetch loop) log + `continue`/`return` so they
  degrade gracefully rather than aborting; pure helpers that fall back safely ignore the error
  (`db/events.go isNameBlocked`, `routes/admin.go effectiveTargetRole`/invite email-check,
  `shouldKeepGroupResponseUserEmails` → treats a fetch error as "not a member"); `routes/stripe.go`
  fulfillment helper logs + returns.

  **Batch 4 DONE 2026-07-22 (final — A2 complete):** the slice getters + `services/` tail.
  - Slice getters in `db/events.go`: `GetEventResponses` → `([]EventResponse, error)` (8 callers) and
    `GetAttendees` → `([]Attendee, error)` (3 callers). All `routes/events.go` handler callers → 500;
    the `shouldKeepGroupResponseUserEmails` helper ignores the error (safe empty-slice fallback).
  - `services/services.go CallApi` → `(*http.Response, error)` (also fixed a latent nil-`req` deref by
    checking the previously-ignored `http.NewRequest` error). Callers propagate: outlook
    `GetCalendarList`/`GetCalendarEvents` (already `…, error`), contacts `SearchContacts` (2 sites →
    `*errs.GoogleAPIError{Code:500}`), and `microsoftgraph.GetUserInfo` → `(UserInfo, error)`.
  - `services/auth/auth.go`: `GetTokensFromAuthCode` → `(TokenResponse, error)` (3 handler callers in
    `user.go`/`auth.go` → 500; the OAuth-error branch now returns an error instead of panicking on the
    marshaled body) and `RefreshAccessToken` → `(AccessTokenResponse, error)` (its only caller,
    `RefreshAccessTokenAsync`, feeds the error into the existing `RefreshAccessTokenData.Error` channel
    field). `microsoftgraph.GetUserInfo` callers: `user.go` handler → 500, `auth.go signInHelper` →
    `return models.User{}, err`.
  - `services/gcloud/tasks.go CreateEmailTask` kept its `[]string` signature (no caller changes):
    reminder-email scheduling is a best-effort side effect of event create/edit, so a failure must not
    500 the event op — env-var/template-id parse errors log + `return []string{}`, and per-task
    marshal/CreateTask errors log + `continue` (partial scheduling still succeeds).
  - **Deliberately left panicking:** `db/init.go:39` (Mongo connect at startup — fail-fast) and
    `auth.go generateOtpCode` crypto/rand (astronomically rare, helper returns bare `string`).

  **Not verified locally (no Go toolchain on this machine) — Backend CI is the gate.**

- [x] **A3 · Unchecked writes in loops.** `S` — **DONE 2026-07-22 (the 3 listed sites).**
  `createEvent` now builds an `[]interface{}` and uses a single `InsertMany` with an error check
  (returns 500 on failure — it runs before the event is inserted, so no partial event). The
  `editEvent` added-attendees insert and the `updateEventResponse` new-response insert now capture
  and log the error (the latter only increments `NumResponses` on success). **Follow-up:** this is a
  subset of a broader pattern — many `UpdateOne`/`UpdateByID` calls across the routes ignore their
  error too (e.g. `updateEventResponse:947`); worth a dedicated unchecked-write sweep.

- [x] **A4 · Remove duplicate `refreshAuthUser` store action.** `S` — **DONE 2026-07-22.**
  Deleted the second (shadowing) definition in `frontend/src/store/index.js`; the original at the
  top of `actions` remains.

### P1 — Structural debt that slows every future change

- [ ] **A5 · Break up `ScheduleOverlap.vue` (4,638 lines, ~99 methods).** `L`
  This is the single largest maintenance liability in the repo — a god-component mixing drag-select
  grid math, availability animation, calendar-account plumbing, sign-up-block editing, and
  respondent hover/selection. Extract cohesive units: a composable/mixin for grid geometry
  (`getRowColFromXY`, `clamp*`, `normalizeXY`, drag lifecycle), one for availability
  fetch/format/animate, and split sign-up-block editing into its own child. No behavior change;
  do it incrementally behind the existing tests.

- [x] **A6 · Split `server/routes/events.go` (1,925 lines).** `M` — **DONE 2026-07-22 (CI-green,
  in 3 incremental commits).** Pure reorg, no behavior change; `InitEvents` (route registration)
  stays in `events.go`. All handlers/helpers moved within `package routes`, so cross-file references
  resolve without changes. Final layout:
  - `events.go` (946 lines) — CRUD/read: `InitEvents`, `createEvent`, `editEvent`, `getEventIds`,
    `getEvent`, `deleteEvent`, `duplicateEvent`, `archiveEvent`.
  - `event_responses.go` (837) — `getResponses`, `updateEventResponse`, `deleteEventResponse`,
    `renameUser`, `userResponded`, `declineInvite` + helpers `findResponse`,
    `shouldKeepGroupResponseUserEmails`, `stripSensitiveUserFields`, `getResponsesMap`.
  - `event_import.go` (226) — `importEvent`.
  - `event_calendar.go` (150) — `getCalendarAvailabilities`.
  Each file's import block was hand-curated (no local Go — verified per-commit by Backend CI, since
  Go errors on unused imports). No route/comment content changed, so Swagger `docs/` need no regen.
  **Now testable in isolation → unblocks B1.**

- [ ] **A7 · Consolidate date libraries (drop `moment`, ideally `spacetime`).** `S`
  `package.json` ships **three** date libs. `moment` has **0** references in `src/` — it's pure dead
  weight (deprecated upstream too); remove it. `spacetime` is used in exactly **1** file vs `dayjs`
  in **9** — migrate that one usage and drop `spacetime` as well. Shrinks the bundle and removes a
  "which lib do I reach for?" decision from every date change. (`date_utils.test.js` guards the
  behavior.)

- [x] **A8 · Add linting to CI (nothing lints today).** `S` — **DONE 2026-07-22 (warnings-first).**
  All lint steps use `continue-on-error: true`, so findings surface in the CI log without blocking
  merges on the existing backlog. **Backend** (`backend-ci.yml`): added `go vet` (scoped
  `go vet $(go list ./... | grep -v '/scripts')` so it skips the non-compiling migration scripts) and
  `golangci-lint` via `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v6` **pinned to v1.61.0** (v2 changed the config
  schema) with a v1-format `server/.golangci.yml` (default linter set; `skip-dirs: [scripts]`).
  **Frontend** (`frontend-ci.yml`): added `eslint@^8.57` + `eslint-plugin-vue@^9.27` as devDeps
  (lockfile regenerated; `npm ci` verified green), a `.eslintrc.cjs` (Vue 2 preset
  `plugin:vue/essential` + `eslint:recommended`; `vue/multi-word-component-names` off since view
  components are intentionally single-word; noisiest rules set to `warn`), `.eslintignore`, a `lint`
  npm script, and a non-blocking `Lint` CI step. Baseline: **102 problems (41 errors, 61 warnings)** —
  that's the backlog to work down before flipping the steps to blocking. **Next:** once the backlog is
  cleared, drop `continue-on-error` to make lint a real gate.

### P2 — Cleanup & smaller components

- [ ] **A9 · Delete dead code.** `S`
  - `server/main.go:254` `splitPath()` — defined, never called.
  - `createEvent` (`events.go:170-238`) carries large commented-out blocks (group-owner response
    seeding, slackbot messaging). Either restore intentionally or delete.
  - `isPremiumUser` getter/util is kept "inert" after the paywall removal (per `REDESIGN_PLAN`) —
    confirm nothing depends on it and remove.
  - `pricingPageConversion` experiment state in the store — leftover A/B infra with no paywall.

- [ ] **A10 · Normalize `fetch_utils.js` error handling.** `S`
  `frontend/src/utils/fetch_utils.js` has inconsistent style (mixed semicolons/indentation from
  line 60) and no shared timeout/abort or centralized snackbar-on-error. Standardize the error
  shape and consider a single interceptor so every call site doesn't re-implement
  `try/catch → dispatch("showError")` (see the repetition in `store/index.js` actions).

- [ ] **A11 · Trim remaining large components.** `M`
  After A5: `Event.vue` (1,815), `NewEvent.vue` (1,011), `RespondentsList.vue` (844),
  `NewSignUp.vue` (827). Each is a candidate for extracting presentational children and moving
  pure helpers into `utils/`. Lower urgency than A5 but same class of problem.

- [ ] **A12 · Remove stray `console.log` (6) and backend `fmt.Println` debug prints (2).** `S`
  Route through the existing `logger` on the backend; drop or gate the frontend logs.

### P3 — Housekeeping

- [x] **A13 · Align Go toolchain version.** `S` — **DONE 2026-07-22.**
  Bumped `server/go.mod` `go 1.20` → `go 1.25` to match the CI toolchain (`setup-go` with
  `go-version: "1.25"` in `backend-ci.yml`). Verified green by CI (no local Go toolchain).

- [ ] **A14 · Prune legacy CORS origins.** `S`
  `main.go:105` still defaults to `schej.it` / `www.schej.it` origins. Harmless, but for an
  invite-only Fellowship instance the default allowlist should reflect the real deployed domain(s).

- [ ] **A15 · Clean up / document migration scripts.** `S`
  `server/scripts/*` reference outdated models and intentionally don't compile (noted in
  `backend-ci.yml`). Fine to keep as history, but a one-line README per dated folder stating
  "run once on <date>, superseded" would prevent someone re-running a destructive migration.

---

## PART B — Test Coverage (its own track — currently thin)

- [ ] **B1 · Cover the core `events.go` handlers.** `M` · **P1**
  The 1,925-line heart of the app has **no test file**. Total Go test code is ~428 lines; JS ~320.
  Prioritize `updateEventResponse`, `getResponses`/`getResponsesMap`, and the
  blind-availability / email-stripping logic (`shouldKeepGroupResponseUserEmails`,
  `stripSensitiveUserFields`) — these encode privacy rules that are easy to regress. Do this
  *after* A6 so the split files are testable in isolation.

- [ ] **B2 · Cover access-control end to end.** `S` · **P1**
  `models/roles.go` has unit tests, but the middleware wiring (`middleware/auth.go` allowlist
  enforcement + `CanInviteRequired`) is the actual gate for an invite-only app. Add handler-level
  tests that a struck-off member's session is rejected and a guest cannot create events.

- [ ] **B3 · Frontend: cover the grid/availability math extracted in A5.** `M` · **P2**
  The geometry helpers are pure functions once extracted — high-value, easy-to-test, and currently
  the riskiest untested logic on the frontend.

---

## PART C — New Features (fit for a ~40-person invite-only club)

### P1 — High value, leverages infrastructure already present

- [ ] **C1 · RSVP / attendance tracking for a *confirmed* gathering.** `M`
  Today the app finds the best time and can schedule a calendar event, but there's no
  yes/no/maybe headcount once a time is locked. For a club that actually meets, "who's coming to
  Saturday's gathering" is the natural next step after "when works." Reuses the `Attendee` model
  and the `Response`→scheduled-event flow.

- [ ] **C2 · Automated pre-gathering reminder emails.** `S–M`
  The Cloud Tasks + email plumbing already exists (`services/gcloud/CreateEmailTask`,
  `Remindee` scheduling in `createEvent`). Extend it from "remind people to respond" to "remind
  confirmed attendees N hours before the event." Very high utility, low new infrastructure.

- [ ] **C3 · "Add to calendar" / `.ics` export for confirmed gatherings.** `S`
  Many club members (esp. spouses) have no Google account (per `ACCESS_CONTROL_PLAN`), so the
  Google-calendar scheduling path doesn't serve them. A universal `.ics` download / "add to
  calendar" link works for everyone and needs no OAuth. The server already parses ICS
  (`services/calendar/ics_calendar.go`) — generation is the mirror of that.

- [ ] **C4 · Plus-one / guest handling on responses.** `S–M`
  The club is "≈12 men + wives." Let a respondent indicate they're bringing a spouse/guest so
  headcounts (C1) are accurate without every spouse needing an account. Small model addition on the
  response/attendee.

### P2 — Strong quality-of-life

- [ ] **C5 · Recurring gatherings.** `M`
  A club that meets regularly benefits from "repeat monthly" rather than recreating an event each
  time. Builds on existing event duplication (`duplicateEvent`, `events.go:1553`).

- [ ] **C6 · Venue / activity poll (not just time).** `M`
  Extend the availability-poll concept to "where / what" — a lightweight multiple-choice poll so the
  club can vote on venue or activity. Overlaps with the sign-up-block UI already built.

- [ ] **C7 · Per-gathering discussion thread / comments.** `M`
  A place to coordinate details ("I'll bring cigars," "parking is out back") attached to the event.
  Fits the club's social nature; keeps coordination off scattered group texts.

- [ ] **C8 · Web push notifications for "new gathering" / "you were invited."** `M`
  A service worker is **already registered** (`register-service-worker`, `kill-sw.js` kill switch),
  so the client half is partly there. Push for invitations and "the time is set" closes the loop
  without relying only on email.

- [ ] **C9 · Sign-up-block capacity + waitlist.** `S`
  The `SignUpBlock` model **already has a `Capacity *int` field** that isn't fully enforced/surfaced.
  Enforce capacity and add a simple waitlist when full — useful for limited-seat gatherings (dinners,
  outings).

### P3 — Nice-to-have / thematic

- [ ] **C10 · Members-only gathering archive ("The Chronicle").** `M`
  The redesign removed the public blog, but an internal, roll-gated history of past gatherings
  (date, attendees, a photo or two) fits the "gentleman's club" theme and gives the Fellowship a
  sense of continuity. Reuses the existing role-gated Fellowship directory work.

- [ ] **C11 · Printable / exportable roster of the Fellowship directory.** `S`
  `Fellowship.vue` / `MemberAdmin.vue` already render the roll; a print-friendly or PDF/CSV export
  is a small addition members would use.

- [ ] **C12 · Map / venue location on an event.** `S–M`
  A `Location` model already exists (`models/location.go`, `location_utils.js`). Surfacing a venue
  with a static map/address on the gathering page is a natural, mostly-wiring feature.

---

## Suggested sequencing

1. **P0 correctness** (A1–A4) — small, safe, removes silent-failure and crash-on-error footguns.
2. **A8 lint-as-warnings + A13** — cheap guardrails so the rest of the cleanup stays clean.
3. **A6 (split events.go) → B1/B2 (tests)** — reorganize the backend core, then lock it with tests.
4. **A5 (split ScheduleOverlap.vue) → B3** — the biggest frontend win; tackle in slices.
5. **Feature track in parallel:** C2 → C3 → C1 (reminder infra → universal calendar → RSVP) are the
   highest-leverage, lowest-new-infrastructure wins for an active club.

---

## PART D — Rebranding (remove all `schej-it` / `schej.it` and `timeful.app` references)

> **Supersedes the CLAUDE.md caveat** ("internal identifiers … still use the old name — leave them
> alone unless rebranding is the explicit task"). This item *is* that explicit task. Scope from a
> 2026-07-22 survey: **~290 `schej*` matches across ~50 files** (234 `schej.it`, 44 `schej-it`, plus
> bare `schej`) and **~69 `timeful*` matches**. Split into a safe/mechanical tier and a
> dangerous/infra tier — **do NOT treat this as one find-replace.**

- [ ] **D0 · Decide the target name(s) first.** `S` · **P3** — **prerequisite / open decision.**
  Nothing below can start until we pick concrete replacements for each identifier class, because they
  have *different* constraints: the **Go module path** (`schej.it/server`), a **public domain** (for
  CORS/nginx/email links), the **Mongo DB name**, the **GCP project id**, and the **brand string**
  ("Schej.it"/"Timeful" shown to users). The fork is "The Fellowship" — but e.g. a Go module path and a
  GCP project id can't contain spaces/caps, so each needs its own decided value. Record them here once
  chosen.

- [ ] **D1 · Safe code/brand renames (mechanical, CI-gated).** `M` · **P3**
  - **Go module path** `schej.it/server` → new path: edit `server/go.mod` `module` directive and the
    `schej.it/server/...` import prefix in **59 `.go` files**. Purely mechanical but touches nearly
    every backend file — **no local Go toolchain, so gate strictly on Backend CI** (do it as one
    dedicated commit so a red build is easy to bisect/revert). `swag init` will also regenerate
    `docs/` with the new path.
  - **User-facing brand strings**: "Timeful"/"Schej.it" in the frontend (`frontend/` — titles, OG
    meta in `main.go`'s NoRoute handler, `package.json` name) and in **email templates / listmonk**
    copy. Cosmetic; low risk once the brand name is decided.
  - `kill-sw.js`, `maintenance_page/`, `server/README.md`, `.env.template` comments — string swaps.

- [ ] **D2 · Dangerous / infra-coupled references (NOT a code-only change).** `L` · **P3**
  These are tied to live infrastructure and data — changing the string in code without the matching
  infra change will break prod. Each needs a coordinated migration, ideally done by the human with VM
  access:
  - **Mongo DB name `schej-it`** (`db/init.go`, `mongodump/mongorestore` commands in docs): renaming
    the database is a **data migration** (`mongodump` old → `mongorestore` into new name → cutover),
    not a code edit. Sequence with a deploy window.
  - **GCP Cloud Tasks project `schej-it`** (`services/gcloud/tasks.go`:
    `projects/schej-it/locations/us-central1/queues/SendReminderEmail`): this is a real **GCP project
    id**. It can only change if the project itself is renamed/recreated — coordinate with whoever owns
    the GCP project or leave as-is.
  - **Domains/CORS/nginx**: `main.go`'s default CORS origins (see also A14), `deploy_scripts/
    nginx_configs/*`, `deploy_scripts/reboot_server_if_down.sh` — must match the **real deployed
    domain**; only change alongside the actual DNS/hosting cutover.

- [ ] **D3 · Historical migration scripts — leave or annotate, don't rename.** `S` · **P3**
  `server/scripts/*` account for ~13 of the `schej` matches but intentionally **don't compile** (they
  reference outdated models — noted in `backend-ci.yml`) and are run-once history. Renaming identifiers
  there is pointless and risks implying they're live. Overlaps with A15 (document the dated folders);
  handle there, not as part of the rename.
